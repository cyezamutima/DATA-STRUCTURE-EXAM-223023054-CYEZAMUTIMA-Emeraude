# example 1
#include <iostream>  This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).
using namespace std; This makes writing simpler (otherwise, we’d have to type std::cout).
int main()  Every C++ program must have a main() function.this is where the program starts.
cout << "Hello, World!"; This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
return 0; This ends the program successfully
# example 2 
int : is a keyword for defining integer as a datatype which allows numbers without decimals. it always followed by a variable. eg. int age; this code shows that any entered age should not having decimals.
double: this is a keyword which specifys double datatype which allows numbers with decimals.
char: this is the keyword which is used in c++ to specify character which allows characters
string as also one of the datatype, it allows combination of characters like any word like name os someone
# example 3
the other codes are almost the same except cin>>name and cin>> age this means that it will take a user input. if it is name or nage.
# example 4
int a = 10, b = 3; this is the initialisationa of variables where the datatype is integer.
cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl; the program will take values we initialized to the variable and add them, later after sum value will be printed to the screen.
cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;  the program will take values we initialized to the variable and subtract them, later after the  value will be printed to the screen.
 as the pothers follows like that the products, division and the results will be printed.
