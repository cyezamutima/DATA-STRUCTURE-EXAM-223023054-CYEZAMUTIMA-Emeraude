Shape Drawing System - Quick Summary
What it is:
A C++ program that creates geometric shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles), calculates their areas, and draws them using text characters.
Key Features:

3 Shape Types: Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
Area Calculation: Each shape computes its own area
ASCII Art: Draws shapes using asterisks and spaces
Dynamic Memory: Manages shapes in expandable array

Technical Highlights:

Object-Oriented Design: Uses inheritance and virtual functions
Polymorphism: Same commands work differently for each shape
Memory Management: Proper allocation and cleanup
Mathematical Formulas: Implements geometry calculations

What it does:

Creates sample shapes
Displays each shape's area
Shows ASCII art representation
Cleans up memory automatically
